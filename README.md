## Instructions

- Do a lab write-up documenting your experience using Static Site Generation (SSG).
- The submission will be a markdown document of approximate length 1-2 pages (300-600 words), although there are no marks allocated for number of words.
- Read about at least 3 different template engines. List what you think might be pros and cons of each. Choose one to use in your assignment. Explain your choice.
- Are there other SSG applications (other than 11ty)? Which ones are popular? What do you think the pros and cons of some of the other options might be?
- Read the configuration section of the 11ty documentation. Which settings are we using and why? Which settings exist that might be worth looking into?
- What is front matter? How does it relate to the web?
