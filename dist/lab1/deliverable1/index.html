      <h1>Lab Write Up</h1>
<h2>Write Up</h2>
<p>My experience using static site generation has been interesting. I had no idea it existed until this semester and it definately has been eye opening.
Its extremely convenient and easy to use and takes away the need of coding raw html.
One of the things I found useful was how I can completely focus on  the actual content on the page and the generator will take care of of creating the html files for me. I hated manually writing and maintaining
multiple html pages. It was way too stressful and annoying especially if the prjects in particular are very big.
I enjoyed learning to work with nunjucks. Reusing layouts and components over multiple html pages are alot easier now than it used to be.
Its just overall objectively better for updating and maintaining consistency throughout the project.
I wont say that there wasn't any challenges because getting familiar with 11ty was annoying simply because it was new to me. Learning how to configure it took some time but the learning curve was managable. Overall using SSG has made building websites
a more structured and enjoyable process.</p>
<h3>Template Engines Comparison</h3>
<p>Here are three template engines I researched:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Nunjucks</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pros</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Has great features like loops, conditionals, and filters</li>
<li>Has reusable components like headers and footers</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Cons</strong>:
<ul>
<li>The syntax is complex</li>
<li>Harder to setup for existing projects that dont use Node.js</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Pug</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pros</strong>:
<ul>
<li>The ability to use conditional logic, loops and variables directly in the template.</li>
<li>Works seamlessly with javascript because its tightly integrated with Node.js.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Cons</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Hard to learn for beginners because the syntax is index based.</li>
<li>Less learning resources are available because its less popular than major engines like Handlebars or Nunjucks.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mustache</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pros</strong>:
<ul>
<li>its a logicless engine so the syntax is extremely simple and clean. Its very beginner friendly.</li>
<li>It can be used with a wide veriety of programming languages like Python, JavaScript and Ruby.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Cons</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Its not really flexible because it can't handle complex logic.</li>
<li>It Lacks features like reusable components or layouts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h4>Choice of Template Engine</h4>
<p>For this project, I chose <strong>Nunjucks</strong> because Its easy to use and I have already been studying it. I'd rather use something I understand than something I dont understand. It will also be better for my future projects because of how versatile it is.
My other projects will be large and I would rather use a templating engine that has similar syntax to traditional html because that's what I have been learning for the past 3 years of my life.</p>
<h3>SSG Alternatives</h3>
<p>Apart from <strong>11ty</strong>, some other popular Static Site Generators include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Gatsby</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pros</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Gatsby can handle both static and dynamic content making it good for all manner of web applications.</li>
<li>It has lots of plugins and starters.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Cons</strong>:
<ul>
<li>You need to learn React and GraphQL which may be overwhelming.</li>
<li>The deployment is complex because you need knowledge of hosting solutions like Netlify or Vercel.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Jekyll</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pros</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Its the default engine for github pages which makes github deployments easier.</li>
<li>Jekyll has a lot of plugins and themes available to extend functionality.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Cons</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Jekylls build times increase significantly with larger sites.</li>
<li>Jekyll is old. The syntax of other SSG alternatives are more intuitive.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hugo</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pros</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Hugo is very fast. Its one of the fastest static site generators.</li>
<li>Hugo has excellent markdown support.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Cons</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Hugos plugin ecosystem is not as good as jekyll or Gatsby.</li>
<li>Hugo isnt built on javascript so it wont be familiar with developers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>11ty Configuration</h3>
<p>In this project, I’m using the following <strong>11ty</strong> configuration:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>addPassthroughCopy</strong>: I'm using passthrough copy to keep the source files organized in the src directory while still making them available in the final output.</li>
<li><strong>eleventy.before</strong>: Im using this configuration to do tasks before the build happens. Before the build happens the src files are separated from the generated output.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, <strong>11ty</strong> provides settings for <strong>Ignoring Templating Files</strong>. So in the future I might use eleventyConfig.ignores to ignore certain files or directories during the build process. There will be many files that aren't relevant  to the site output so this would definately be useful.</p>
<h3>Front Matter</h3>
<p>Front matter is the metadata included at the top of a file, written in Markdown, TOML, or JSON. Front matter usually has information about the document like the title and date or any other relevant data. Its related to the web because for example
in static site generators like Eleventy, front matter allows you to define how the content should be processed and rendered.</p>
<p>Here’s an example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">---
layout: layouts/default.mustache
title: Lab Write Up
---
</code></pre>

    </div>

    <footer class="text-center bg-dark">
  <p class="name text-white">
    &copy; <span id="currentYear"></span> Nathaniel Mais | 
    <a href="/lab1/tac" class="text-white">Terms and Conditions</a>
  </p>
</footer>

     <script>
      window.onload = function() {
        const currentDate = new Date();
        const year = currentDate.getFullYear();
        const month = currentDate.toLocaleString('default', { month: 'long' });
        const day = currentDate.getDate();

        document.getElementById("currentYear").textContent = `${day} ${month} ${year}`;
      };
    </script>
